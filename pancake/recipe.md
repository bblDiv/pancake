Step 1: Mix Dry Ingredients.
In a small bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.

Step 2: Mix Wet Ingredients
In a separate bowl, combine the buttermilk, eggs, butter and vanilla extract.

Step 3: Combine Wet + Dry
Mix wet ingredients into the batter just until there is no visible dry flour. Be careful not to overmix the batter.

Step 4: Let the Batter Rest
Ever notice that your last griddle of homemade pancakes is your best? That’s because it’s best to let the batter rest for at least 5 minutes (and up to 30 minutes).

Step 5: Grease the Griddle
Heat your griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount of solid shortening and swirl to coat. Before adding your pancake batter, wipe excess grease away; more is not better here. If you don’t have a griddle, no worries—you can use a skillet. Grease it with shortening the same way you’d grease a griddle.

Step 6: Pour the Batter
Pour your homemade pancake batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto the greased hot griddle. Make sure to leave enough room between pancakes for expansion.

Step 7: Wait…and Flip
See those bubbles forming on top of the pancakes? Wait about 30 seconds, or after bubbles start to break, before flipping.
Pro tip: Don’t fiddle with the pancakes! You’ll knock the air out that keeps them fluffy.

Step 8: Finish ’em Off
Cook until the second side is golden brown.

The next time you need to know how to make homemade pancakes—like when you’ve got a craving and the wait time at your favorite brunch place is just way too long—you’ve got it in the bag. Not the box.
